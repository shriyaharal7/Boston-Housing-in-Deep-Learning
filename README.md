# Boston-Housing-in-Deep-Learning

 Implemented a regression model for the Boston housing for prediction of the house price.

 Performed outlier handling treatment, EDA, preprocessing, correlation, and created a heat map.

 Built a Neural network model for various optimizers, activation functions, kernel initializers, cross entropies with n number of hidden layers.

 Using Tensor board visualized the data that helped to track the losses. The R2 score of the model was 80.5%
